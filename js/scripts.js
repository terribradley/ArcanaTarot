    image: "img/Fool.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Fool:</strong> The Fool is a very powerful card in the Tarot deck, usually representing a new beginning -- and, consequently, an end to something in your old life. The Fool's position in your spread reveals which aspects of your life may be subject to change. The Fool signals important decisions ahead which may not be easy to make, and could involve an element of risk for you. Approach the changes with optimism and care to gain the most positive outcome."
  },{
    image: "img/Magician.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Magician:</strong> The Magician generally associates with intelligent and skillful communicators. His presence in your spread indicates a level of self-confidence and drive which allows you to translate ideas into action. A practical card, the revelations it brings are best applied to the pragmatic and physical aspects of your life, rather then the ephemeral or theoretical. Your success in upcoming ventures in politics or business will likely hinge upon your own strength of will and determination."
  },{
    image: "img/Empress.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Empress:</strong> Traditionally associated with strong maternal influence, the presence of the Empress is excellent news if you are looking for harmony in your marriage or hoping to start a family. Any artistic endeavours you are currently associated with are also likely to be more successful, as this card often finds those exposed to strong bursts of creative or artistic energy. That creative energy may not be in the form of a painting or art project, however: This card also suggests a very strong possibility of pregnancy -- not necessarily yours, but you might be seeing a new addition to your extended family or the family of a close friend in the near future! This card is a good sign for you and those around you."
  },{
    image: "img/card_4.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Emperor:</strong> Counterpart to the Empress, the Emperor signifies a powerful influence, generally male in nature. This can also include concepts in your life historically considered masculine, such as leadership and authority, self-discipline, and stability through the power of action. Its positive influences suggest you may be on a path to advancement or promotion, but it can also be neutral. Often a companion to those destined to take on greater responsibility, it may indicate change or loss that necessitates you stepping forward to shoulder a greater burden than you have in the past. Whatever the driving force for the change, it indicates you may possess an uncommon inner strength that will compel you act and to lead."
  },{
    image: "img/Priestess.png",
    reading: "<strong>The High Priestess:</strong> Your identification with the High Priestess suggests you possess inherent good judgment, in the form of strong intuition. She may indicate that reason should take second place to instinct. Your head must trust in the wisdom of your heart for a change. Yet, she is also an aide by nature, and her presence in certain parts of your spread could be indicative of someone close to you coming to your rescue with their own intuition. Intuition is most effective at seeing what is hidden to the senses, so the High Priestess may also come as a warning of concealed facts or influences that are, or will be, important to you."
  },{
    image: "img/Hierophant.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Hierophant:</strong> Depending on your nature, the Heirophant can mean very different things. At its root, it represents doctrine, but doctrine can come in the form of teaching and guidance or rigid authority. Where it appears in your spread is also important, as it is most often indicative of your own approach to the moral, religious, and social conventions of the world. Considered wisely, it helps show the path towards fulfillment."
  },{
    image: "img/Lovers.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Lovers:</strong> Your first instinct will most likely be to associate this card as representing love, but, much like love, it is not quite that simple. Not only does love come in many forms, but the Lovers may indicate important or difficult choices ahead in your life. This is bad, in that the choices it signals are generally mutually exclusive, paths to two very different futures, but also good, in that it confirms that at least one of those paths will take you to a good place. As such, if you happen to find it in your spread, you should consider it carefully, but not fear it. It tells a story of difficult choices, likely painful, but that the correct decision and a positive outcome are within your grasp."
  },{
    image: "img/card_7.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Chariot:</strong> You have some hard work ahead of you. It may be resolved quickly, but the Chariot is a powerful card, and the labor you are undertaking will probably trend towards the long and difficult. You will quite possibly experience rough roads, long uphill slopes, dead ends, and painful setbacks. A good outcome is only assured if the card is upright, but do not let yourself lose hope: This hard road will instil in you a strength of purpose, the ability to succeed through organization and endurance, and the confidence possessed only by those who have done what they thought they could not. Harnessed correctly, few forces can stand against an individual like that."
  },{
    image: "img/card_8.png",
    reading: "<strong>Strength:</strong> Strength is the rawest form of power, and you possess it in some form. It is a very positive card if you are fighting illness or recovering from injury. As might be suspected, its influence over you, and the use you put it to, can trend towards light or dark. You likely trend towards facing your problems courageously, head-on, and conquering them through perseverance and will. However, with this ability to overcome life's obstacles, comes the responsibility to control yourself, and this card may be a warning to take command of your own actions or emotions before they damage you or the people you care about."
  },{
    image: "img/Hermit.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Hermit:</strong> There are times in every life, when one must step back and carefully examine their situations and decisions. Finding the Hermit in your spread suggests this is such a time for you. You are in need of a period of inner reflection, away from the current demands of your position. This retreat can be physical, or a search within. Only a deep and honest introspection will lead to a solution, however."
  },{
    image: "img/card_10.png",
    reading: "<strong>Wheel of Fourtune:</strong> Symbolic of life's cycles, the Wheel of Fortune speaks to good beginnings. Most likely, you will find the events foretold to be positive, but, being aspects of luck, they may also be beyond your control and influence. Tend to the things you can control with care, and learn not to agonize over the ones you cannot."
  },{
    image: "img/card_11.png",
    reading: "<strong>Justice:</strong> Justice is a very good card to find in your spread if you have acted with kindness and fairness towards others and especially if you have been a victim. It is a significant indicator of a positive resolution, although how and what sort will depend on your own experiences. If you have been unfair, abusive, or otherwise shady and immoral in your dealings, be careful. For the unjust, this card is, at best, a dire warning to change your ways before retribution falls upon you, and, at worst, a simple statement that it is already too late. In neutral cases, it may simply be telling you to seek out balance in your life."
  },{
    image: "img/Hang_Man.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Hanged Man:</strong> The Hanged Man can be interpreted in two very different ways. All change is a small kind of death, as the old must die to create the new, and it may simply indicate upheaval or change in your future, perhaps beyond your control, but more likely a decision that, for good or ill, you will not be able to turn back from. The other interpretation is one of sacrifice, although whether this sacrifice is small or great may not be easily interpreted. Both interpretations imply permanence, and that you should give very careful thought to the decisions in your life."
  },{
    image: "img/card_13.png",
    reading: "<strong>Death:</strong> Death is indicative of change in your future. This change can be in almost any aspect of your life, but it will almost certainly be permanent, significant, and absolute. Death suggests a complete severance between the past and the future, and it will likely be painful. Despite the sense of loss that may accompany it, Death fills an important and natural role in life, and leads eventually to acceptance. It is a necessary part of moving forward, and you will find the changes easiest if you embrace them, rather than fight them. Expect the end of a close friendship, a job, a marriage, or even a life, but do not focus too greatly on the negative."
  },{
    image: "img/card_14.png",
    reading: "<strong>Temperance:</strong> An optimistic card, Temperance encourages you to find balance in your life and approach problems with a calm demeanour. It recognizes that opposing forces need not be at war within you. Tread carefully in any major decisions you make, with confidence that good decisions will lead to a good resolution for you."
  },{
    image: "img/card_15.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Devil:</strong> The Devil is in the business of entrapment. It signifies a situation from which there is no escape, or a road leading to one. Forewarning may let you avoid the trap, or it may not. What sort of trap, and how you might avoid it, depends on where the Devil appears in your spread, and what other cards surround it. This card does not foretell doom, only the need for prudence."
  },{
    image: "img/card_16.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Tower:</strong> Dark and foreboding, the Tower is the embodiment of disruption and conflict. Not just change, but the abrupt and jarring movement caused by the unforeseen and traumatic events which are part of life. The Tower in your spread is always a threat, but life inevitably involves tragedy, and you must decide whether you will face it with grace."
  },{
    image: "img/card_17.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Star:</strong> The Star's presence signifies a period of respite and renewal for you. This renewal may be spiritual, physical, or both. It is a particularly positive sign if you or someone close is recovering from illness or injury. It is a light in the darkness, illuminating your future and your past."
  },{
    image: "img/card_18.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Moon:</strong> Something in your life is not what it seems. Perhaps a misunderstanding on your part, or a truth you cannot admit to yourself. It may also indicate something important being kept from you by another. This may be a source of worry or depression in your life, and the Moon is a strong indicator that you must rely on your intuition to see through the deceit."
  },{
    image: "img/card_19.png",
    reading: "<strong>The Sun:</strong> As an inherently good influence, finding the Sun is a positive development. It suggests personal gain, and that personal goals and joy are within reach, if you are willing to invest the effort to actualize them. If you are embarking on a new personal venture, such as marriage or beginning a family, the Sun is of particular influence."
  },{
    image: "img/card_20.png",
    reading: "<strong>Judgement:</strong> Judgment tells a story of transition, but unlike Death or the Tower, it is not sudden change, or born of luck or intuition, but change that springs from reason. It signifies plans, often long in the making, coming to fruition. If it points towards the future, it may also speak towards the nature of the change; if there is a choice that needs to be made, think deeply and let your mind guide the decision. Logic, in this case, is a better guide than intuition. Be prepared to make a major decision in your life, likely one that will shape the next chapter of your life."
  },{
    image: "img/card_21.png",
    reading: "<strong>The World:</strong> The World is an indicator of a major and inexorable change, of tectonic breadth. This change represents a chance for you to bring about a desirable end to the Old and a good beginning to the New. It is indicative of growing maturity, a sense of inner balance and deeper understanding. It suggests that you may be approaching a more final sense of identity, and the security in the self that comes with age. It also represents the falling away of boundaries, sometimes in the effusive sense of the spiritual, but sometimes in a purely physical sense, indicating travels or journeys in the future."
  },{
    image: "img/card_22.png",
    reading: "<strong>King of Cups:</strong> The Knight of Cups encourages you to remember that victory is not just an exercise in strength of arms, but can be achieved through cleverness and a savvy mind. He can also be given to flights of wild fancy, so you may also interpret him as a warning to maintain your focus. New initiatives in your life are likely on their way, and you must remember to seek novel paths to accomplish goals, but also not lose sight of where you are going."
  },{
    image: "img/card_23.png",
    reading: "<strong>Queen of Cups:</strong> Sensitivity and an affectionate nature are traditionally associated with the Queen of Cups, who is the emotionally open balance to the King. Despite her open nature, you will still find her influence to be largely passive. Particularly for men, her presence is a reminder to stay in touch with the emotional aspects of their character. You should take her presence as a gentle hand seeking to show you the power of your own inner aspects, whose power may be obscured by their quiet nature."
  },{

  },{
    image: "img/card_26.png",
    reading: "<strong>Page of Cups:</strong> The Page of Cups, if it refers to you in your spread, suggests an introspective nature, inclined towards art, and possessing a kind heart. You may let credit you deserve pass you by out of shyness. The card may also be indicative of someone, likely overlooked, in your own life who is in a position to aid you in pursuit of a specific goal. Although somewhat dependent on its position in your spread, the Page is generally the bearer of good news."
  },{
    image: "img/card_27.png",
    reading: "<strong>Ten of Cups:</strong> You can expect to attain a longterm goal if you find the Ten of Cups in your spread. This card has, like the rest of the Cups, many emotional undertones. It may signal the mending of bridges between friends or family members you were once close to, if there has been a rift. You may also find that it symbolizes your own inner emotional turmoil being resolved. In reference to marriage it is usually indicative of lasting emotional bonds."
  },{
    image: "img/card_28.png",
    reading: "<strong>Nine of Cups:</strong> The Star's presence signifies a period of respite and renewal for you. This renewal may be spiritual, physical, or both. It is a particularly positive sign if you or someone close is recovering from illness or injury. It is a light in the darkness, illuminating your future and your past."
  },{
    image: "img/card_29.png",
    reading: "<strong>Eight of Cups:</strong>The Eight of Cups suggests that there is stability and security in your life, but at a personal cost. You are probably unfulfilled by your current life. Depending on the rest of your spread, it may be a strong push for you to move on, and find the courage to strike out in a new direction. You will have to look closely at your work, your relationship, and your own beliefs to identify the source of your dissatisfaction, and then decide if you are willing to set aside some of your life's stability in order to find happiness."
  },{
    image: "img/card_30.png",
    reading: "<strong>Seven of Cups:</strong> This card speaks strongly to your inner self. It is trying to tell you something about your unconscious or the realms of your imagination. Your hopes, dreams, and unrealized aspirations are all fair game to the Seven of Cups. It speaks of a deep confusion, or a lack of understanding of your true motivations by your conscious mind. It is time to look carefully at your own motivations and reexamine your goals, but it is also a risky time to act upon your conclusions."
  },{
    image: "img/card_31.png",
    reading: "<strong>Six of Cups:</strong> The Six of Cups is rooted deep in the past, but it is also a card closely bound to your happiness. It suggests that your family, your old friends, perhaps even past lovers, are in the process of adding greatly to the joys in your life. This card may also refer to past efforts, labours of love, and personal projects rewarding you, usually in an emotional sense, rather than financial."
  },{
    image: "img/card_32.png",
    reading: "<strong>Five of Cups:</strong> This card is a dark omen. Like the rest of its suit, it is bound your emotions, and it brings with it a warning of loss and disappointment. Expect a setback in your life, almost certainly emotional. It may be a project or goal you are particularly invested in emotionally. In certain positions it might also refer to events of the past which continue to cause regret or heartache. The only solution is optimism; this too shall pass."
  },{
    image: "img/card_33.png",
    reading: "<strong>Four of Cups:</strong> Apathy is the most insidious of evil. If its influence remains unchecked you may lose yourself, and not even realize what you have lost. This card is a strong warning that you must break out of your current cycles. Seek out causes or people to care and fight for. Make new goals, and then seek out new paths to reach them. Now is the time to take risks, as the price of failure is far less than the cost of no longer seeking success."
  },{
    image: "img/card_34.png",
    reading: "<strong>Three of Cups:</strong> This card is both a portent of celebration and cause for it. It tells of great happiness in the future for you, and not of the passing kind, but secure joy which will last and be shared with those around you. Commonly associated with the completion of a meaningful project, or, even more likely, a birth."
  },{
    image: "img/card_35.png",
    reading: "<strong>Two of Cups:</strong> The single resounding theme associated with the Two of Cups is partnership. What sort of partnership is less clear, but you are in the past, present, or future, part of a powerful one. This partnership will involve absolute trust and command respect. It may, of course, be a particularly emotional love affair, but it could just as easily be a deep and abiding friendship. The exact nature may be revealed by the rest of the spread. It will be a source of happiness for you, a presence in your life you can count on at every turn, and whose well-being will be as important to you as your own."
  },{
    image: "img/card_36.png",
    reading: "<strong>Ace of Cups:</strong> The Ace of Cups signifies the beginning period of strong emotional health for you. Expect copious joy, happiness, and love to surround you during this time. Existing personal relationships may strengthen, meaningful new ones are likely to form. If marriage is in your future, you are likely to lay the foundations for it during this time."
  },{
    image: "img/card_38.png",
    reading: "<strong>King of Swords:</strong> The King of Swords represents the professional aspects of authority. Often associated with those in legal or business careers, he most likely represents someone who will aid you in one of these fields. This person may be assertive, or even seek to dominate you in their confidence that they know how best to aid you. While they may be friendly, their primary motivation is unlikely to be emotional."
  },{
    image: "img/card_39.png",
    reading: "<strong>Queen of Swords:</strong> The Queen of Swords represents a very perceptive individual, sharp-witted and professionally distant. You will most likely find her to be your aid and counsel, possibly a teacher. Not necessarily female, but likely to be, this person should be trusted and may take an interest in you, but that interest is unlikely to be romantic. A powerful ally, respect her intelligence and you will be rewarded with guidance."
  },{
    image: "img/card_40.png",
    reading: "<strong>Knight of Swords:</strong> If you or someone close to you is represented by the Knight of Swords, beware. It is symbolic of a forceful personality, one which combines zealous dedication to success with razor-sharp intellect. However, whether in the form of a companion or your own inner nature, these same attributes can give rise to a formidable enemy. When it refers instead to your circumstances, the Knight suggests you are headed for turbulent times, which can be most successfully faced with decisive action on your part."
  },{
    image: "img/card_41.png",
    reading: "<strong>Page of Swords:</strong> Depending on your nature, the Heirophant can mean very different things. At its root, it represents doctrine, but doctrine can come in the form of teaching and guidance or rigid authority. Where it appears in your spread is also important, as it is most often indicative of your own approach to the moral, religious, and social conventions of the world. Considered wisely, it helps show the path towards fulfillment."
  },{
    image: "<strong>img/card_42.png",
    reading: "<strong>Ten of Swords:</strong> The Ten of Swords is a cause for fear for any who believe in the power of the cards, and you should prepare yourself for whatever it suggests. It is one of many cards which can represent disaster, but unlike the others, this card predicts a disaster which cannot be avoided. It foretells not only a complete failure but an unavoidable one. What is more, the failure will not be small or easily overcome. This is not a fortune to be changed or avoided, only endured. If you stay strong, new dreams can be built from the ashes."
  },{
    image: "img/card_43.png",
    reading: "<strong>Nine of Swords:</strong> One of the more negative card to discover in your spread, the Nine of Swords foretells or describes a powerful mental anguish. The source of this anguish may well be within you, arising from you being too quick to cast a negative light on your actions or abilities. It may also arise from paranoia. Despite often being unfounded, your pain can take the form of sleeplessness, of fear, depression, loneliness and isolation. Beware pushing away those who are seeking to help you, and find the courage to reach out for help. Even if these feelings are based in reality, it may be difficult for you to clearly find a solution in your current state. Carefully consider the other cards in your spread, look for cards associated with potential sources of aid and counsel."
  },{
    image: "img/card_44.png",
    reading: "<strong>Eight of Swords:</strong> Some things in life are beyond your control, and the Eight of Swords suggests that you are being actively held back by some of them. This can be something as personal as a bad boss or as sweeping as international politics. In any case, you are likely finding your options restricted at every turn, and may be experiencing rising frustration and anxiety. Your best course of action lies with the only thing you can control: You. Approach this situation with patience, and be ready to move when the situation changes."
  },{
    image: "img/card_45.png",
    reading: "<strong>Seven of Swords:</strong> Another card which indicates forces opposing you, the Seven of Swords points to there being a single source of your frustration. This is both positive, in that you may be able to identify that source and change your circumstances, and negative, in that this source may well be aware of you and deliberately sabotaging you. The road to your success does not lie in direct confrontation, however, but instead in guile. Instead of attacking the obstacles raised against you, find ways around them."
  },{
    image: "img/card_46.png",
    reading: "<strong>Six of Swords:</strong> Your mental focus can put you on track to leave your current troubles behind, leading to better times ahead. It is important to face your problems from a mental standpoint, thinking through them. There is still trouble ahead for you, but the worst is over."
  },{
    image: "img/card_47.png",
    reading: "<strong>Five of Swords:</strong> This card indicates conflict in your life. Worse yet, it is closely associated with defeat. It is likely that the defeat will be traumatic, and you will need to retreat and regroup. Your may have suffered injury to your pride or self-esteem, but the Five of Swords is also a warning of a potential to get caught in the cycle. Handle defeat with grace, move on, and success will come to you."
  },{
    image: "img/card_48.png",
    reading: "<strong>Four of Swords:</strong> Representing order and stability, combined with the tumultuous nature of the Swords, the Four of Swords offers you respite from the battles in your life. The peace may be temporary, but appreciate it while it lasts. It may point towards recovery from prolonged illness."
  },{
    image: "img/card_49.png",
    reading: "<strong>Three of Swords:</strong> The presence of the Three of Swords in your spread suggests significant pain in your life. This pain is likely caused by, or the result of, conflict, perhaps due to disrupted partnership or friendship. This pain may be part of a new beginning, but you must face your pain honestly to overcome it."
  },{
    image: "img/card_50.png",
    reading: "<strong>Two of Swords:</strong> Like crossed blades, the Two of Swords represents a balance of forces. Not necessarily an absence of struggle, but an equal distribution of force in opposition. It may indicate you are in a position to mediate a conflict, or it may instead suggest you are caught in the middle of a dilemma with no clear outcome. The resolution of this state will likely bring peace for you."
  },{
    image: "img/card_50.png",
    reading: "<strong>Ace of Swords:</strong> The Ace of Swords is, like all of the Aces, the purest embodiment of its suit. In relation to your personality or your actions it implies a strong element of focus, determination, and an intellectual capacity. It may suggest change through conflicting forces, possibly internal."

It can also represent an association with a masculine authority figure, a leader and arbitrator. You may find yourself aided in solving a dispute. Be open to the advice of those with more experience than yourself."

    reading: "<strong>Queen of Wands:</strong> The Queen of Wands is associated with an outgoing and friendly personality, indicating you are extroverted but self-contained.

    reading: "<strong>Ten of Wands:</strong> If the Ten of Wands appears in your spread, you are likely working too hard, or taking on more burdens than you should. It can indicate both excessive workloads in pursuit of your goals, or as a result of attaining them."
  },{
    image: "img/card_50.png",
    reading: "<strong>Nine of Wands:</strong> The Nine of Wands is a bittersweet discovery in your spread, as it suggests both struggles ahead and the capacity within you to overcome them. Your life is probably comfortable at the moment, but there are also likely signs of trouble in some of the less critical aspects of your personal or professional life. Your inner strength will be called upon to maintain the current situation, and then to move forward when progress becomes possible for you."

    reading: "<strong>Eight of Wands:</strong> Prepare yourself for an abrupt increase in the pace of your life. Things are about to get very busy. They good news is that any projects you begin will progress quickly, you will experience few delays, and the conclusion is likely to be successful. This card is also good news for relationships, although it raises the possibility of needing to travel for relationships. All things considered, this is a good card to find in your spread, as long as you are willing to buckle down and get to work."

Whether in the form of recognition for your past work or material reward, some level of success is in your future. If you are waiting for some particular news, this card is most likely a signal of good news. However, it is also gentle reminder that magnanimity and grace should accompany your success. To avoid losing friends and inviting retributions, do not let the good fortune go to your head."
  },{
    image: "img/card_50.png",
    reading: "<strong>Five of Wands:</strong> The Five of Wands is never a welcome card, as long tradition suggests you will be in line for struggle and aggravation. Pay close attention to the surrounding cards to discover clues about which areas of your life will be subject to these conflicts. Expect them to be rooted in competition, and console yourself that a positive solution is not outside your reach. Just be prepared for the possibility that the victory will come at a personal cost."

    reading: "<strong>Four of Wands:</strong> Peace and security follow in the wake of the Four of Wands, usually in the smaller aspects of your life. Do not let the limited scope bring you to underestimate the joy that simple successes can bring, however: This is a card of good endings and fresh starts. Its presence should be welcome if you are beginning a new relationship or a new phase of one, such as marriage or engagement, and is especially good for those about to move residences."

    reading: "<strong>Three of Wands:</strong> If you can manage to consistently bring your creativity and inventiveness to the table, then the Three of Wands brings good news. You are about to enter a time where your potential for productivity and accomplishment is very favourable. Keep your eyes open for new career opportunities and your mind open to new possibilities. The rewards these new opportunities bring, however, will take some time. You will need to be patient and stick around for the long haul. Also, look for new allies, as any new undertakings will be most successful if undertaken as partnerships."

    reading: "<strong>Two of Wands:</strong> The Two of Wands suggests the formation of partnerships in your immediate future, or the success of already existing joint ventures.

The rewards indicated are due to you, so this is better news for those in equitable partnerships than those who seek to profit at the expense of others. The presence of this card may also point to underlying insecurity or worry on your part. These feelings may be justified or not, based on the rest of the spread."

    reading: "<strong>Ten of Pentacles:</strong> Your financial security and emotional well-being are both positively indicated by the presence of this card in your spread. This is only partially your own doing, however, as these positive aspects are inextricably bound up in your close relationships with friends and family. It may also foretell an inheritance."

    reading: "<strong>Nine of Pentacles:</strong> The Nine of Pentacles represents significant financial reward, but one borne of hard work and careful planning on your part; a just reward for prudent actions. It may also indicate that a time of hardship for you is ending and a counter-balancing time of pleasant living is at hand. On a less positive note, it also indicates a solitary individual, so you may still be searching for companionship, and lack people to share your gains with."

    reading: "<strong>Eight of Pentacles:</strong> If you are involved in any work requiring creative inspiration or craftsmanship, the Eight of Pentacles is a very positive card. This is especially true if you are using skills you are still trying to master. This is as likely to be a hobby as your primary work. Unlike most of the suit, financial gain is not necessarily indicated, but a spiritual reward is. This is also not a guarantee, but rather a suggestion that if you are prudent and organized in your attempts, success is the likelier outcome."

    reading: "<strong>Seven of Pentacles:</strong> A balanced card by nature the Seven suggest you will avoid failure, but fall short of runaway success in an endeavour. Or, equally possible, that you will achieve your goals, but not in the time frame you had hoped for. You will face setbacks, and in order to succeed you will need to take care to avoid becoming too hesitant or timid. Progress may be slow or difficult, but it is possible."

    reading: "<strong>Six of Pentacles:</strong> Success in your life is bound up in generosity. This may mean your prosperity will arise from your investment in others, perhaps a financial investment, or maybe advice and support for a friend. This card can also mean the reverse, that your success will arise from the generosity of someone else. The two are, of course, not exclusive, and drawing this card suggests you naturally lean towards kind acts and charity."

    reading: "<strong>Five of Pentacles:</strong> The Five of Pentacles can, depending on the rest of your spread, refer to financial matters, employment, or relationships. Unfortunately, it is a negative indicator for all of them, suggesting duplicity, loss of jobs, and the possibility of infidelity. This is a time for you to carefully evaluate what matters in your life and work out your priorities, such as whether your job or your relationship matters most. In order to mitigate the damage in some areas of your life, you may have to let some of the others fall away."

    reading: "<strong>Three of Pentacles:</strong> If you can maintain a clear sense of purpose over the coming months, you are well positioned to see your hard work get the recognition it deserves. While it is not guaranteed, and it may tax your interpersonal skills, if you maintain your own pace and trust in others, recognition will be yours. That outcome will be worth your determination, as it may not only provide material reward, but also lead to a sense of lasting accomplishment"

    reading: "<strong>Two of Pentacles:</strong> The Two of Pentacles is, as always, bound up in the forces of change, and of balance. Like its brothers, the Two of Pentacles can mean good or ill, but it as a strong indicator that the status quo will be disrupted. There will be challenges in your future, but your fate is largely in your own hands in the sense that the final outcome depends own how you respond to these challenges.
